# webDownloader v0.1
Golang implementation of a method of downloading websites - built for our Senior Project Peer to Peer Web Cache.

This project is ment for education purposes as a tool in order to develop a peer to peer web cache capability. The repository to that one is currently private, though this tool seems universally useful so I felt should be seperate and public.

Usage: webDownloader {Website URL}

Will contain more options in potential future releases
